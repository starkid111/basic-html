    <h1>I,m Ramadan Adewale</h1>
    <img src="/image1.jpg" alt="" width="100px">
    <p>My Name is Ramadan, a fulltime student of yaba college of technology in the department of Electrical Electronics Engineering and also an advancing front end developer at axia africa  whose aim is to contribute and make a lasting impact to the evolution of the tech land scape and connecting with more developers. <br>
    In additon i,m kind of shy but i won't let the shy part get into my learning cause i,m the type of person that don't really know how to associate with people or talk to people i am not familiar with , but since being a front end developer needs being able to associate with people that means i dont have a choice 😹.
    lately i've being learning how to associate and communicate with people cause i know it will help the career i,m building for myself.
<br>
 There is more but that's all i can say about myself for now.Thank you.
    <br>
